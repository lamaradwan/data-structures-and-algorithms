## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
O(n) for time and space

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
We have 3 classes:
1. Node -> Initiate the value, right and left
2. BinaryTree -> pre_order, in_order, and post_order methods
3. BinarySearchTree -> add and contains methods
